# StarCraft II ReinforcementLearning bot project description

This project was launched to implement a reinforcement learning based agent which is able to play the well-known game Starcraft II. In order to speed up the implementation process We're utilizing [PySC2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) from Deepmind which is a component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### First Steps

We should download and install PySC2 package. The easiest way to do that is using the following command from commanline (Linux)

```
$ pip install pysc2
```

If you want to be sure that the your current python environment (or any other program which use python) will not crashed due to the installations of the packages, it is highly recommended to use [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) which is providing an isolated environment for python independently to your current system.

## Versioning
